Accessibility is very important for making the utility of the Web open to everyone. In the USA there is very important legislation called the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that says individuals cannot be discriminated against due to a disability that individual has. Another way of saying this is, if a user cannot perform a required act to interact with a company's service, that company must find another way for that user to get that service. This is most obvious for physical disabilities, such as adding wheelchair ramps to external stairs, but this also applies to digital services like websites. In recent years large companies have been sued for such reasons, for example Domino's Pizza [^1]. But these lawsuits are not limited to large companies, with over 1,000 suits filed in 2018 [^2].

Making a website more accessible is not just important to protect against potential legal action, it can improve customer satisfaction, reduce customer service inquiries, and potentially add or retain customers with accessibility impairments.
